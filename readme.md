# Busbot
[In Progress]

A chat bot that utilises Facebook messenger to convery Translink bus times.  It's written in Javascript and utilises the serverless framework to automatically deploy to AWS infrastructure.  This documentation will be updated shortly.  At the moment it's just a placeholder that contains the serverless project files.
